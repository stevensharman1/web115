    <p>Welcome to my WEB115 site! This is the central hub where you can access my introduction, contract, and other class work. Over the semester, I’ll be using this space to practice building websites while learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
    <p>Feel free to explore the links in the navigation menu and learn more about me, my commitments to this course, and my progress as I improve my web development skills.</p>
